This is my new portfolio page.

The goal of this is to update my current portfoliio with cleaner code and a more personal touch, alongside showing off a more natural representation of my coding skills now.

Initial planning:-
-Set up some folders and files to get started
-Look into some cool examples that you can add
-Focus on getting the content on the page 
-Then add styling

Cool things to add:-
-Light/Dark mode
-Return to top of site
-Links to pages with projects with a fuller decription of my process(?)
-Animations of button clicks




Styling notes:-
-Re-upload screenshots but make them all the same size so I have a constant within the cards
